This project is a high performance digital ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between real

time social signals and high authority search distribution. It provides a fully automated Content

Factory. The pipeline is engineered to capture the Zero Hour window by monitoring high velocity

platforms like X and RSS feeds to identify breaking trends the moment they surface. These

signals are then autonomously processed into Discover optimized WordPress articles that

prioritize curiosity driven engagement, mobile first performance, and strict Google News

compliance.

1\. Technical Requirements (Action Items for Hunter)

To ensure the pipeline is grounded in data and matches the success of your chosen

competitors, Asif requires the following items to begin Phase 1:

Target Site List

Provide 3 to 5 URLs of high performing sites currently dominating your niche in

Google Discover.

WordPress Environment

Provide credentials (Application Passwords) for REST API access

and a dedicated staging or production environment.

API Access

Provide developer credentials for X API for per minute news monitoring and your

preferred LLM provider such as Claude, Gemini, or Grok.

Google Search Console Access

Provide shared access to monitor the Discover Performance

Report and ensure indexing is happening at high speed.

Brand Guidelines

Provide author bios and high resolution logos to satisfy Google E-E-A-T

(Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) criteria.

2\. Technical Architecture and Methodology

The system will be built using a Multi Agent Orchestration model, ensuring that the scraping,

writing, and publishing layers work in a continuous loop:

Sourcing (The Scout)

A Python based watcher using Playwright and Scrapy to monitor X.com

and RSS feeds. It focuses on brand new articles to ensure we are the first to publish.

Analysis (The Architect)

A reverse engineering agent that crawls your provided example sites

to extract their exact HTML structure, meta tag patterns, and visual ratios.

Generation (The Creator)

A specialized Gemini 3 Pro engine using deep thinking to produce

800 to 1200 word articles with curiosity gap titles.

Publishing (The Pilot)

An automated bridge to WordPress that handles hero image generation

(1200px WebP), SEO meta tags, and Schema.org markup.

3\. Project Timeline (6 Week Roadmap)

Phase 1: Research (Week 1\)

Reverse Engineering.

Deliverables: Deep dive into competitor HTML and CSS structure and Discover success factors.

Phase 2: Sourcing (Week 2\)

The Pulse Monitor.

Deliverables: Deployment of the 60 second refresh cycle for X.com and RSS monitoring.

Phase 3: Intelligence (Week 3\)

The Logic Bridge.

Deliverables: Fine tuning the AI to write in the exact style and format of example sites.

Phase 4: Automation (Week 4\)

The Publishing Bridge.

Deliverables: Fully functional WordPress REST API integration with 1200px image automation.

Phase 5: Launch (Week 5\)

Operational Alpha.

Deliverables: Initial launch of 5 posts per day with automated API cost tracking.

Phase 6: Scaling (Week 6\)

Production Grade.

Deliverables: Scaling to 20 posts per day and monitoring Discover impressions in Search

Console.

AI Automation Expert for Google Discover-Optimized WordPress Blog Pipeline  
Your profile stands out with expertise in AI automation, LLM integrations (Claude, GPT, Grok, etc.), workflow tools ([Make.com](http://make.com/), n8n, Zapier, Python/CrewAI), etc.  
I need to leverage these skills for a content/blogging experiment \- RSS/API news fetching, content rewriting pipelines, and WordPress auto-publishing.  
Ex: automated systems that fetch news via RSS/API → rewrite with AI → auto-publish to WordPress  
I need to build a WordPress blog aimed at rapid Google Discover traffic by replicating the proven structure and style of high-performing example sites already in google discover... (I'll share URLs once we chat).  
The system needs to:  
Fetch fresh breaking news/events via RSS or APIs  
Use AI to rewrite into original, Discover-optimized articles (curiosity titles, hero images, 800-1200 words)  
Exactly match example sites' on-page structure, meta tags, and technical setup (mobile speed, visuals, etc.)  
Auto-publish 5-20 posts/day, with API cost tracking  
Include AI-driven analysis to identify and adapt to current Google Discover success factors (key metrics, formats, concepts—either manually researched or automated)

1\. Purpose of This Project  
The purpose of this project is to build a fully automated “Content Factory” that:  
1\. Detects breaking news and trending topics in real time  
2\. Generates long-form articles optimized for Google Discover  
3\. Publishes articles to WordPress automatically  
4\. Supports scaling without requiring a writing team  
This gives you the ability to consistently capture traffic during the critical “Zero Hour” of  
emerging trends.  
2\. What the System Will Do  
The final product will:  
✔ Monitor X.com and RSS feeds for trends (every 60 seconds)  
✔ Score and filter trending topics  
✔ Generate 800–1200 word articles with curiosity headlines  
✔ Publish articles automatically through the WordPress REST API  
✔ Track indexing & performance in Google Search Console
